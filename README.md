# List of React Fundamental concepts used in the project

1. JSX (JavaScript XML) – Used for defining the structure of components.
2. Components & Props – Functional components are used with props for data passing.
3. State Management (useState) – Handles dynamic UI updates in cart, wishlist, and sorting.
4. Side Effects & Lifecycle (useEffect) – Fetching data from local storage, handling UI updates.
6. Conditional Rendering – Disabling purchase button when cart is empty, showing a 404 page.
7. React Router (react-router-dom) – Navigation between Home, Dashboard, Stats, and other pages.
8. Local Storage – Data persistence for cart and wishlist across page reloads.
9. Dynamic Class & Styling – Used useLocation() to change styles based on routes.
10. React Hooks (useNavigate, useLocation) – Redirecting users, detecting current page.
11. List Rendering (map()) – Displaying product cards, cart, and wishlist items.
12. Forms & Controlled Components – Used in filtering and sorting functionalities.
13. Error Handling & Edge Cases – Preventing duplicate wishlist items, limiting cart total to $1000.
14. Third-party Libraries:
    - React Icons (react-icons) – Used for UI icons.
    - React hot toast – Used for toast notifications on adding to cart/wishlist.
